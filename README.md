# Brain: 2D cellular automaton

## Short description

2D cellular automaton. Starts with small random seed.

Three types of cells: passive, active, cooldown.

- active becomes cooldown
- cooldown becomes passive
- passive becomes active if it has exactly two active neighbours

## Requirements

Python 3 (didn't try with 2), numpy, pygame.

## Usage

Just run the script. Look inside for some parameters to adjust.
